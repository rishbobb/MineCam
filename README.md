# MineCam
Play Minecraft with your webcam!

Mod JAR available under Releases

# Notes
I didn't really want to release this since it is by far incomplete and sometimes unusable, but many people have asked so I have finally released it.
It is missing many many optimizations and implementations that could 100x the experience.

# Further Updates
No further updates will be provided by me, I stopped being serious about this project in early 2022.

# Controls
This is played while standing up in full view of camera

Use your head to move around the head in-game
Walking in real life moves the character forward
Jumping in real life makes it jump
Mining in real life makes it mine

Hold fingers up on left hand for different functions:
- 1: right click
- 2: escape
- 3: inventory
- 4: right click
- 5: hotbar slot

When entering a menu the left hand is used as a pointer device. Moving the left hand moves the pointer and making a fist (grabbing) grabs items
When entering the escape (pause game) menu, the left hand pointer is not present, but using 2 fingers will exit the screen.
